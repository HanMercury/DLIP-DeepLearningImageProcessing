## 1. Introduction

Proper waste sorting is essential for resource circulation and environmental protection. However, incorrect or careless recycling practices often reduce the efficiency of waste management systems. In particular, **contaminated items** (e.g., food-stained containers) are often disqua	lified from recycling.

This project aims to develop an **AI-based image classification system** that can automatically detect both the **type of waste** and whether it is **clean or contaminated**, thereby enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of waste sorting.

## 2. Problem Statement

- ## Project Objectives

  - To improve recycling efficiency through automated image-based waste classification.
  - To reduce reliance on human labor in waste sorting on campus.

- ## Expected Outcome and Evaluation

  - **Improved Sorting Accuracy**: Demonstrated classification of delivery containers and recyclables into at least 3 categories (e.g., clean plastic, contaminated, general waste) with over 85% accuracy.
  - **Labor Reduction**: Reduced manual intervention during sorting by at least 50% during test runs.
  - **Scalability**: Prototype can be deployed in dormitories, cafeterias, and student lounges with minimal supervision.
